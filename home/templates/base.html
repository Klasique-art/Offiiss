            <li>7. Except as otherwise provided in these Terms, all consideration payable under these Terms in relation to any supply is exclusive of GST.
            </li>
            <li>7.1 If GST is payable in respect of any supply made by a supplier under these Terms (GST Amount), the recipient must pay to the supplier an amount equal to the GST payable on the supply. Subject to clause 6.4, the recipient must pay the GST Amount at the same time and in the same manner as the consideration for the supply is to be provided under these Terms in full and without deduction, set off, withholding or counterclaim (unless otherwise provided in these Terms).
            </li>
            <li>7.2 The supplier or its agent must provide a tax invoice to the recipient before the supplier will be entitled to payment of the GST Amount under clause 6.3.
            </li>
            <li>7.3 If these Terms require a party to pay, reimburse or contribute to any expense, loss or outgoing suffered or incurred by another party, the amount which the first party must pay, reimburse or contribute is the sum of:
                (a) the amount of the payment, reimbursement or contribution, less any input tax credit in respect of the payment, reimbursement or contribution to which the other party is entitled; and
                (b) if the payment, reimbursement or contribution is subject to GST, an amount equal to that GST.
                </li>
            <li>7.4 If an adjustment event occurs in relation to a taxable supply under these Terms:
                (a) the supplier must issue an adjustment note to the recipient within 7 days after becoming aware of the adjustment; and
                (b) any payment necessary to give effect to that adjustment must be made within 7 days after the date of receipt of the adjustment note.
